simple command-line application made for fun ᵃⁿᵈ ᵃ ᶠʳᵉᵉ ᵗˢʰᶦʳᵗ with python, allowing a user to login with a username and password *or* create an account.

- while not an ideal solution, created users are stored in a json file in the project's root.
- stored passwords are hashed through [`bcrypt`](https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/).
- once a user successfully logs in, they're introduced to their own "personal" hub, in which they can run certain commands.

## hacktoberfest contributions
